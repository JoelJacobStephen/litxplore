Provide a comprehensive, in-depth analysis of this academic paper. Extract and explain each section in detail.

CRITICAL: Return ONLY valid JSON. NO markdown code blocks, NO extra text, JUST the JSON object.

IMPORTANT JSON FORMATTING RULES:
1. Use \\n for paragraph breaks within strings (NOT actual newlines)
2. Escape all quotes within text as \\"
3. Do not use actual line breaks inside string values
4. Each field value must be a single continuous string with \\n for paragraphs

Return JSON matching this exact structure:
{{
  "introduction": "First paragraph here.\\n\\nSecond paragraph here.\\n\\nThird paragraph here. (4-6 paragraphs total covering: background context, motivation, problem domain overview, significance, and how this fits into broader research)",
  
  "related_work": "First paragraph here.\\n\\nSecond paragraph here. (4-6 paragraphs total covering: key previous approaches, their strengths and limitations, gaps in literature, comparisons, and what distinguishes this work)",
  
  "problem_statement": "First paragraph here.\\n\\nSecond paragraph here. (3-5 paragraphs total covering: problem definition, research questions/hypotheses, assumptions, scope, and why this problem is important)",
  
  "methodology": "First paragraph here.\\n\\nSecond paragraph here. (5-8 paragraphs total covering: approach description, algorithms/techniques, experimental design, implementation, parameter choices, data handling, evaluation metrics, and method justification)",
